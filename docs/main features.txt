Main Features of AI-Based Smart Lawyer
🧠 1. AI Chatbot (RAG-Powered Legal Assistant)

Core Idea:
A bilingual (English–Urdu) chatbot that answers user questions related to Pakistani civil law using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

How it works:

Converts the user’s question into embeddings.

Retrieves relevant legal statutes or judgments from Qdrant (vector DB).

Passes them to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate an answer.

Displays the citations with source names and direct links (e.g., “Civil Procedure Code, Section 9, Pakistan Code link”).

Purpose:
Provides accurate, verifiable, and explainable legal answers — not just guesses.

🔍 2. Advanced Filtering System

Users can filter search results based on:

Court: Supreme Court, Lahore High Court, etc.

Year: Retrieve judgments from a specific time frame.

Law/Section: Focus on a particular statute (e.g., Contract Act, 1872).

Backend: Uses metadata fields stored with each document in Qdrant & MongoDB Atlas.

Purpose: Helps professionals narrow down results for more precise research.

⚖️ 3. Judgment Summarization

Automatically generates concise summaries of long court judgments.

Approach:

Uses text chunking and summarization via the Gemini model.

Highlights main issues, verdict, and legal principles.

Output Example:
“In this case, the Supreme Court held that a contract signed under coercion is voidable under Section 15 of the Contract Act.”

📄 4. Contract Summarization (User Upload)

Users can upload or paste contracts, and the system generates:

Summary of key clauses

Detection of risky or unusual terms

Plain-language explanation

Pipeline:
Upload → Text extraction (PyMuPDF/pdfminer) → Summarization via Gemini API → Display structured summary.

Purpose:
Helps students or small business owners quickly understand legal documents.

🗣️ 5. Voice Input and Output (Bilingual)

Speech-to-Text:

Accepts voice queries in Urdu or English.

Uses models such as Whisper API or Google Speech Recognition API.

Text-to-Speech:

Converts system responses into spoken Urdu or English (for accessibility).

Uses tools like gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) or Azure Speech API.

Purpose:
Enables hands-free interaction, helpful for visually impaired users or those who prefer verbal communication.
